# ResponsiveSite-1
<p>This project was originally a code challenge given to me from my first interview. At the time I was not able to complete it 100% and did not move forward with the interview process</p>

<p>I have since then reattempted the project on my own. The original goal was to use the jpg and individual static images given to me by the interviewer and recreate the website displayed on the jpg.</p>

<p>Everything was created using CSS. I used media queries to make sure it was fully responsive for mobile and ipad devices.</p>
